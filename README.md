# Game-Whats_your_teams_next_step
This repository contains everything needed to play the game: whatâ€™s your team's next step?

If you want to play right away, go to the /game_materials/ directory. Print the board files on A3, the rest on A4 paper. It is nice to print the different types of cards on different colour paper, then it is easy to recognize them. Cut the cards out, shuffle the decks and play! The deailed_rules.pdf contains details on all the rounds, and in /presentation/ there is a presentation that can help you to give an introduction to the game.

If you finish a game and the team feels okay to share the result, it would be great if you put photo in the /games_played/ folder for others to see. You can also tweet it to me then I will put it up (@salvadorven).

I would love to develop this game further, so feedback is appreciated! Add a ticket or pull request, the source files are on /sources/. I am especially interested in nice quotes on the cards to spice them up, feel free to insert them in the /sources/card_texts.xlsx . Additionally, any thought on improving the game are welcome!

Have fun playing the game!
