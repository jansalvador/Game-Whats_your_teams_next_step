# Game: What's your team's next step
This repository contains everything needed to play the co-op boardgame: whatâ€™s your team's next step?

This game has been developed for teams to explore which agile practice could help them solve the problem they are currently facing. It can be used for fun, when problems arise or as part of a retrospect. It can also be used as a way to share knowledge across a group. Estimated time for a whole game: one to one and a half hour.

If you want to play right away, go to the [/game_materials/](/game_materials/) directory. Print the board files on A3, the rest on A4 paper. It is nice to print the different types of cards on different colour paper, then it is easy to recognize them. Cut the cards out, shuffle the decks and play! The deailed_rules.pdf contains details on all the rounds, and in [/presentation/] there is a presentation that can help you to give an introduction to the game.

If you finish a game and the team feels okay to share the result, it would be great if you put photo in the /games_played/ folder for others to see. You can also tweet it to me then I will put it up ([@salvadorven](https://twitter.com/salvadorven)).

I would love to develop this game further, so feedback is appreciated! Add a ticket or pull request, the source files are on /sources/. I am especially interested in nice quotes on the cards to spice them up, feel free to insert them in the /sources/card_texts.xlsx . Additionally, any thought on improving the game are welcome!

Have fun playing the game!
